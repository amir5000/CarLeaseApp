## Short discription:
Start by entering the miles per year that you are allowed on your lease, then select the term length of the lease with the starting day and month. The results will show how many miles you would acumulate over the years of the lease and what amount of miles per month you would get to drive. 
Once you have the allowed miles you then can calculate based on which term year you are in how many miles you have for the current month we are in.
