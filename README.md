## Short discription:
You enter the your miles per year, then select the amount of years the lease is for with the starting day of the month. The results will show how many miles you would acumulate over the years of the lease and what amount of miles per month you would get to drive. 

### Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery

### To Do's:
* Add a new section to calculate if the user wants to buy more anual miles on their lease and how much that would cost them.
* convert the year to be done in months per terms instead of just years to be more standard with the industry.
